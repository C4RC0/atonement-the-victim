## Concept

This artwork is also part of a series in which I rework my previously painted oil paintings with modern technology.

## The first reproduction

In 2012, I painted this reproduction on a 40x50 canvas with oil.

## How was it made?

I made this version in 3D with awesome [Three Js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) library. In this interactive form, it is also valid as an independent artwork within the new-media-art genre.
